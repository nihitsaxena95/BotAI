```
Binaries, installers, and source tarballs are available at https://nodejs.org.
```

### Installing Angular 4

```
   1. Make sure you have node version above 6.9 and npm above 3
   2. Check the version by using node --version and npm --version
   3. Install angular cli using npm install -g @angular/cli
   4. -g installs the angular globally on your system and you just have to run this command only once
   5. Create the angular project using ‘ng new angularprojectname’
   6. Go to that project folder and check the angular version by ‘ng -v’

    Upgrade this version to angular 4 by running this command-

    For Windows- npm install @angular/common@next @angular/compiler@next @angular/compiler-cli@next @angular/core@next @angular/forms@next @angular/http@next @angular/platform-browser@next @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@next @angular/platform-server@next @angular/router@next @angular/animations@next --save

For Linux/Mac- npm install @angular/{common,compiler,compiler-cli,core,forms,http,platform-browser,platform-browser-dynamic,platform-server,router,animations}@next --save

Make sure to upgrade the typescript version by running command- npm install typescript@2.2.1 --save

Ignore whatever warning it shows up and now check the angular version by ‘ng -v’ The version has changed from 2.2.4 to 4.1.0

You can also check all the info about your angular cli in package.json file.

```
### Installing MongoDB
```

npm install --save mongodb
```
